<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a Security Engineer. I have done everything from penetration testing 
to incident response to training and my interests are equally varied. The reason this blog is here
is for me to write about things that I am learning about. I have found that I learn things
better when I write them down and try to explain them to others, so that's why this blog 
exists! If you're reading this before I get many posts up I am planning on posting about
security topics, programming, and other technical topics related to my personal hobbies.</p>

<p>I have written some other blog posts at <a href =  "https://warroom.securestate.com/index.php/author/malarkey/"> The War Room </a>.
I may get around to moving them over here, but I recommend the blog either way.
These are more specifically security oriented, but you should still check them out.</p>
