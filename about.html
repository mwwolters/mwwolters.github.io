<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I currently am a IT Security Consultant. I do everything from penetration testing 
to incident response to training and my interests are equally varied. The reason this blog is here
is for me to write about things that I am learning about. I have found that I learn things
better when I write them down and try to explain them to others, so that's why this blog 
exists! If you're reading this before I get many posts up I am planning on posting about
security topics, programming, and other technical topics related to my personal hobbies.</p>

<p>I have written some other blog posts at <a href =  "https://warroom.securestate.com/index.php/author/malarkey/"> The War Room </a>. These are more specifically
security oriented, but you should still check them out.</p>
